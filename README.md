# PySort
PySort is a basic python script to sort numbers using MatPlotLib.

It puts a list of numbers into order, with some visual appeal. The algorithms used are artificially slowed to create more visual appeal.  The default script utilizes Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. It asks for a number input in the console, then sorts the given umber.


**Bubble Sort**

Bubble sort goes through the list in passes, and swaps numbers that are out of order. If it comes across a 10 followed exactly by a 5, it swaps the two.


**Insertion Sort**

Insertion Sort works by having two sections: a sorted section and an unsorted section. It goes through the unsorted section, and puts numbers into their place in the sorted section, slowly building it up.


**Selection Sort**

Selection sort finds the smallest number in the unsorted section and swaps it to the front of the sorted section.
